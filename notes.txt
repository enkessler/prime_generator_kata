Design notes:
- Off the shelf prime generator and tester used in order to focus on simplicity of overall project/deliverable
and due to time constraints.

- Future improvements: A more performant sieve could be implemented. The Sieve of Eratosthenes relies on the
assumption that any unvisited number (in particular, the first number) in a range must be a prime. This means
that if we want to not have to calculate the list from 2 every time, we need to ensure that the first number in
our search list is still a prime. We could use the #is_prime? method to check for primes starting at the
beginning of the input range and, once one is found, kickstart the sieve from there. This will let us only have
to spend time calculating primes that fall within the input range.
